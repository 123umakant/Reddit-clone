# Reddit Clone

Reddit is a social platform where users submit their posts and other users express their views by commenting on the post. Users can also upvote and downvote based on if they like it. If a post gets lots of upvotes it will be shown on the front page so the people can see it. If it gets downvotes it quickly falls and disappears from most peopleâ€™s views.
